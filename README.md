# EV Data Analysis Using Python

This project analyzes electric vehicle (EV) data using Python to generate insights, perform hypothesis testing, and build a recommendation system.

## Objective
The goal was to:
- Filter and group EVs based on price and range
- Analyze average battery capacity per brand
- Identify outliers in energy consumption
- Visualize trends between battery capacity and range
- Build a simple recommendation engine
- Test hypothesis between Tesla and Audi engine power

---

## Dataset
The dataset includes information like:
- Price (PLN)
- Range (WLTP)
- Battery capacity
- Torque, power, acceleration
- Make & Model

---

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Statistical Testing (t-test)
- OOP (EVRecommender class)

---

## Key Tasks

### Task 1: EV Filtering and Grouping
- EVs under 350,000 PLN with â‰¥400 km range
- Grouped by Make and averaged battery capacity

### Task 2: Outlier Detection
- Identified energy consumption outliers using IQR

### Task 3: Visualization
- Scatter plot: Battery capacity vs Range (WLTP)

### Task 4: Recommendation Engine
- Class-based filtering for EV suggestions based on user input

### Task 5: Hypothesis Testing
- Compared Tesla and Audi engine power using t-test
